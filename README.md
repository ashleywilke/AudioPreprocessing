# AudioPreprocessing

Tutorial followed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qj1piMAPE0

App is not currently functioning.

Potential issues could be: 
1. Changed ```AVFormatIDKey``` to ```kAudioFormatLinearPCM``` since we are using .wav files.
2. Do not currently have exception catching implemented

If you are able to get the code running, the next step would be attempting different preprocessing steps on the recorded audio. :)
